# Functions-and-Errors-ETH-AVAX
Overview
This project provides a simple smart contract in Solidity that demonstrates the use of functions and error handling. The contract is designed for both the Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX) blockchains.

# Description

This project serves the purpose of fulfilling a requirement for ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course of Metacrafters

## Getting Started

## Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Open a Solidity file in the repository and copy the code and paste it to the IDE you use.

Add sol suffixes in your file name if you try to run it to the IDE so it read as a SOLIDITY FILE

## Reminder
Be aware and alert for some errors:

You will notice if your code have an error check on the upper right side of your screen you will your mini-minimize entire code there that have a red lines, blue lines mean you are in that lines and red lines means error.

- You will see a Red Exclamation Mark in that line so you will notice that there some errors

Check your File name if its red

Don't forget to count and check some valuable symbols

{ } , [ ] , ( ) , ;
